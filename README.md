# Hybrid-Mixes-Origins-HCAs

This mod aims to give you the best of two worlds of having the fusions of the final and prototype tracks made by the Mastered Realm, SilvaGunner and PoloBlue and yes the tracks are properly looped and blue spheres speeds up!

The featured arrangements are:
Carnival Night Zone Act 1 & Act 2 (High Quality Version) - by SilvaGunner
Ice Cap Zone Act 1 & Act 2 (MJ Sound Team Remix)- by Mastered Realm
Launch Base Zone Act 1 & Act 2 (Hybrid Mix) - by PoloBlue

The rest of the tracks have been replaced by the S3AIR remasters in a similar way CW and Stealth did it, so say goodbye to the low-pass filter! 

Happy listening!
